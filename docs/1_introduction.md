## Overview
Time Announcement is a Flutter mobile app that announces the current 
time at pre-scheduled moments throughout the day using text-to-speech (TTS).

Unlike regular alarm apps, Time Announcement lets users set multiple 
time announcements so they always know what time it is without 
looking at the phone and without needing to dismiss or disable an alarm.

This allows users to keep track of time passively, with the app 
announcing the time at moments they choose, with no screen interaction 
required.
